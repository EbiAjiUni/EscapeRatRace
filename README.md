# Escape the Rat Race

## What is the rat race?

> A rat race is an endless, self-defeating, or pointless pursuit. The phrase equates humans to rats attempting to earn a reward such as cheese, in vain. It may also refer to a competitive struggle to get ahead financially or routinely.
> The term is commonly associated with an exhausting, repetitive lifestyle that leaves no time for relaxation or enjoyment.

## What is the purpose of this page?

In this repository, I will attempt to collect online contents related to the Rat Race, the Anti-Work culture and how to manage to individually live a life outside the unreasonable demands of most modern, capitalistic societies. I will also attempt to gather people to start an open, friendly and constructive conversation to search for a collective solution within the legal and economic systems in which we live in.
